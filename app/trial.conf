# Mender MCU client
# Integrate Google Trust Services Root R4 certificate together with Amazon Root CA 1 certificate

CONFIG_MENDER_NET_CA_CERTIFICATE_TAG_PRIMARY=1
CONFIG_MENDER_NET_CA_CERTIFICATE_TAG_SECONDARY=2

# PSA APIs
# TF-M profile type 'small' has only symmetric cipher to keep the size of the binary small
# Particularly, the support of ECDSA with SHA384 which is required to parse the Google Trust Services Root R4 certificate need to be added to the configuration
# This is achieved using the following configurations
CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_ECDH=y
CONFIG_PSA_WANT_ALG_ECDSA=y
